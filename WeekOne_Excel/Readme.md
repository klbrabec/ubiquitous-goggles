# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine how various campaign types perform related to their defined funding goals and launch timeframes.  This analysis will 
assist in defining the funding goals for future projects and when to launch them onto crowdfunding platforms in order to have the best results.  Additionally, 
information as included as part of this analysis will allow for the comparison of theater based projects to other types of projects to determine if the creation
of a theater project is the best option for project development.

## Results

### Outcomes based on Launch Date
As indicated in the graph above, launch dates do factor strongly into the performance of a crowdfunding project.  Year over year, the months with the highest numbers of successful projects are May and June. The highest number of failed projects falls into the May launch window (52 projects), with July and October being close
behind with 50 projects each. 

The total number of theater projects included in the data set includes the majority of projects being launched within the April to August time frame.   If more projects were lanched in the September through March time frame, they were not included in this data set.  There is a potential that outcomes may change based on additional information for those time frames. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals 
The graph above shows the relationship of a project's success to its defined goal amount.  The higher the goal set, the less likely that the project will succeed. For example, no projects that had an initial goal set between $45,000 and $49,999 were successful, while only 13% of projects with goals set 50,000 or higher were successful.  It would  appear that the 'sweet spot' for successful projects is at the $35,000 to $44,999 range.  It is interesting to note that 76% of projects with a goal set under $1,000 were successful.  This could be contributed to the 'excitement' of being involved in a small project as a backer, but it would necessitate the interviewing of participants to determine if this is truly the case.  

### Challenges and Limitations
The provided data used in this analysis includes nine separate high level categories, including film & video, theater, and music.  Each of these parent categories
encapsulate multiple sub-categories, allowing for further refinement and targeted analysis of performance within the various sub-categories.   However, the categories
assigned to the data do not appear to describe all potential types of events in the theater space.  For example, we are limited to plays and musicals, however 
theater events often include comedy, lectures, and other types of events that would not be included in those two sub-categories.  This could potentially exclude 
poorly performing or highly performing productions that would need to be considered prior to making final decisions and project plans. 

### Additional Analysis Points 
In addition to examining the outcomes based on goals and launch dates, it may be beneficial to do comparisons between theater projects and other project types.
This would be beneficial in determining if there is more participation and funding on other project types.  Additionally, geographic analysis should be done
in order to determine if there are factors there that would contribute to the successful funding of a project.
